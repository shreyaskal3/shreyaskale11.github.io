## Stage 2: Data Warehouse Concepts

- **WHY DATA WAREHOUSE?**

- Understanding data warehouse concepts is important for data engineers because it helps them create organized repositories of information, like a well-structured library, making it easier to find and use data for analysis, just as a librarian organizes books for easy access.

> - [Books/Kimball_The-Data-Warehouse-Toolkit-3rd-Edition.pdf](https://www.bing.com/search?q=kimball+the+data+warehouse+toolkit+pdf&qs=UT&pq=kimball+the+data+warehouse+toolkit+&sc=4-35&cvid=43EED73798C64B198D59BA24354CE15D&FORM=QBRE&sp=1&ghc=1&lq=0){:target="\_blank"}

- Okay, I hear you ðŸ˜Š If you are an absolute beginner, I understand this might be a little overwhelming for you. To overcome this, I have taken a simple approach by noting down some of the most important topics in data warehousing, which are more than enough to get started as a data engineer. The topics are as follows:

- **TOPICS**

- **Test your Learnings!**

- Once you are done learning the AZ-900 concepts, itâ€™s now time to test your learnings. There is a wonderful website called ExamTopics that will have DUMPS (real-time questions) for the certifications. You can use this website to answer the questions and test your learnings. Make sure you learn all the questions before you book the exam. One thing to be aware of is that, for each question, there will be a discussion tab. Make sure you read the comments from the discussion and validate the right answer for the question (mostly the highly voted one will be the right answer). It is important to check the discussion because sometimes the answer given to the question might be wrong, so please go through the discussion tab for all the questions.
