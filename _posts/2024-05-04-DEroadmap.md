After creating a free account, you can try creating different Azure tools by watching the video 
series below to get a better understanding of how each of these tools works. 
 
> **Azure Data Factory** 
 
Azure Data Factory (ADF) is a cloud-based Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) tool provided by 
Microsoft Azure that helps organizations move and transform data from various sources to 
destinations. Think of it as a data orchestration tool that allows you to create, schedule, and 
manage ETL data pipelines.

> **Azure Synapse Analytics** 
 
Azure Synapse Analytics is a cloud-based analytics service by Microsoft Azure which offers big 
data and data warehousing functionalities. The platform offers a unified experience for data 
professionals, facilitating collaboration and efficient analysis through integrated workspaces and 
notebooks.

> **Azure Databricks**

Azure Databricks is a cloud-based big data analytics platform provided by Microsoft Azure in 
collaboration with Databricks. It combines Apache Spark, a powerful open-source analytics 
engine, with Azure's cloud services to provide a fast, easy, and collaborative environment for big 
data and machine learning.

Azure Data Lake Storage is a cloud-based storage service provided by Microsoft Azure that is 
specifically designed for big data analytics. It allows organizations to capture, store, process, and 
analyze large amounts of data in a scalable and cost-effective way. Azure Data Lake Storage is 
often used in conjunction with other Azure services, such as Azure Databricks and Azure Data 
Factory, to build comprehensive big data and analytics solutions.
