# Basic SQL Queries

## SQL vs MySQL

**SQL** is a standard language that stands for Structured Query Language, based on the English language. SQL is the core of the relational database, used for accessing and managing databases.

**MySQL** is a database management system. MySQL is an RDMS (Relational Database Management System) like SQL Server, Informix, etc.

## Subsets of SQL

There are different subsets of SQL, each serving a specific purpose:

- **Data Definition Language (DDL):** It allows you to perform various operations on the database, such as `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DELETE` objects.

- **Data Manipulation Language (DML):** It allows you to access and manipulate data. It helps you to `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and retrieve data from the database.

- **Data Control Language (DCL):** It allows you to control access to the database. Examples include `GRANT` and `REVOKE` access permissions.

- **Data Query Language (DQL):** The primary statement in this category is `SELECT`, which is used to query and retrieve data from one or more tables.Other DQL operations include various clauses used with `SELECT` such as `FROM`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and more. These clauses help refine and filter the data being retrieved.

> Note: The `DELETE` operation can be considered both a DDL and a DML operation, depending on the context.


## Data Definition Language (DDL)

### CREATE Statement
The `CREATE` statement is used to create a table in a database.

```sql  
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    column3 datatype,
   ....
);
```

### DELETE Statement

The `DELETE` statement is used to delete records from a table.

```sql
DELETE FROM table
WHERE condition;
```
> Note: The `DELETE` operation can be considered both a DDL and a DML operation, depending on the context.

## Data Manipulation Language (DML)

### INSERT Statement

The `INSERT` statement is used to insert data into a table.

```sql
INSERT INTO table (column1, column2)
VALUES (value1, value2);
```

### UPDATE Statement

The `UPDATE` statement is used to modify existing records in a table.

```sql
UPDATE table
SET column1 = value1
WHERE condition;
```

## Data Control Language (DCL)

### GRANT Statement

The `GRANT` statement is used to grant access privileges to a user.

```sql
GRANT privilege_name
ON object_name
TO {user_name |PUBLIC |role_name}
[WITH GRANT OPTION];
```

### REVOKE Statement

The `REVOKE` statement is used to revoke access privileges from a user.

```sql
REVOKE privilege_name
ON object_name
FROM {user_name |PUBLIC |role_name};
```

## Data Query Language (DQL)
### SELECT Statement

The `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table
WHERE condition;
```

### INNER JOIN

The `INNER JOIN` keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

### LEFT OUTER JOIN OR LEFT JOIN

The `LEFT OUTER JOIN` or `LEFT JOIN` keyword returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table1
LEFT OUTER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

### RIGHT OUTER JOIN OR RIGHT JOIN

The `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` or `RIGHT JOIN` keyword returns all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table1
RIGHT OUTER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

## Aggregate Functions

### COUNT

The `COUNT` function is used to count the number of rows in a result set.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(column)
FROM table;
```

### AVG

The `AVG` function calculates the average value of a numeric column.

```sql
SELECT AVG(column)
FROM table;
```

## Window Functions

Window functions operate on a set of rows related to the current row.

### ROW_NUMBER()

Assigns a unique integer to each row within a partition.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY column1 ORDER BY column2) AS row_num
FROM table;
```

### RANK() and DENSE_RANK()

Assigns a rank to each row based on the values in the ORDER BY clause.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY column2) AS rank
FROM table;
```

### LEAD() and LAG()

Access data from subsequent or previous rows in the result set.

```sql
SELECT column1, LAG(column1) OVER (ORDER BY column2) AS previous_value
FROM table;
```
