# Advanced Data Analysis and Reporting

## SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)

SSRS is a server-based reporting platform that enables the creation and deployment of interactive, graphical reports.

### Creating a Basic Report

1. Design the report using SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT).
2. Add a dataset with a SQL query.
3. Design the report layout.

## SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)

SSAS provides online analytical processing (OLAP) and data mining functionality for business intelligence applications.

### Creating a Cube

1. Define a data source.
2. Create a data source view.
3. Define dimensions and measures.
4. Deploy the cube.

## Machine Learning with SQL Server

SQL Server provides integration with machine learning services.

### Enabling Machine Learning

```sql
EXEC sp_configure 'external scripts enabled', 1;
RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE;
```

### Running R Scripts

```sql
EXEC sp_execute_external_script
  @language = N'R',
  @script = N'Your R Script Here';
```

## SQL Server and Azure Integration

Leverage the integration capabilities between SQL Server and Microsoft Azure.

### Azure SQL Database

Migrate your SQL Server database to Azure SQL Database for cloud-based scalability.

### Azure Data Factory

Use Azure Data Factory for data integration and orchestrating complex workflows.


These advanced topics in data analysis, reporting, machine learning, and Azure integration showcase the versatility of SQL Server in a modern data ecosystem.
