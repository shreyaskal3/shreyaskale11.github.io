### XAI (Explainable AI) methods

These methods help in understanding and interpreting machine learning models, making them more transparent and trustworthy.

**SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**

- SHAP values are a unified measure of feature importance based on cooperative game theory.
- They provide consistency and local accuracy, making it possible to explain individual predictions.

**LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**:

- LIME explains individual predictions by locally approximating the model around the prediction.
- It generates interpretable models (e.g., linear models) to understand the behavior of complex models.

**Integrated Gradients**:

- A method for attributing the prediction of a deep network to its input features.
- It works by integrating the gradients of the model's output with respect to the input along a straight path from a baseline to the input.

**Other**:

- **Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs)**: Show the relationship between a feature and the predicted outcome while keeping other features constant.
- **Permutation Feature Importance**: Measures the change in model performance when a feature's values are randomly shuffled.
- **Counterfactual Explanations**: Identify the minimal changes needed to a data point to change its prediction.
