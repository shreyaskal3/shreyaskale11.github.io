    - Designed for clear, logical code that is easy to read and learn.
    - Lots of existing libraries and frameworks written in Python allowing users to apply Python to a wide variety of tasks.
    - Focuses on optimizing developer time, rather than a computer’s processing time.
    - [Great documentation online: **docs.python.org/3/**](https://docs.python.org/3/){:target="_blank"}

- **What can you do with Python?**
    - This course first focuses on “base” Python, which consists of the core components of the language and writing scripts and small programs.
    - Later we begin to learn about outside libraries and frameworks that greatly expand Python’s capabilities.
    - Automate simple tasks 
        - Searching for files and editing them
        - Scraping information from a website
        - Reading and editing excel files
        - Work with PDFs
        - Automate emails and text messages
        - Fill out forms

## Data Structures

### Lists

- **Definition**: 
  - In Python, a list is a collection of elements, ordered and mutable.
- **Syntax**:
  ```python
  my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana']
  ```
- **Mutability**:
  - Lists are mutable, meaning you can change, add, or remove elements after the list is created.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Suitable for an ordered collection of items where you might need a flexible data structure.
- **Common Operations**:
  - **Append** (`list.append()`): `Adds an element to the end` of the list.
  - **Extend** (`list.extend()`): `Adds all elements of an iterable to the end` of the list.
  - **Insert** (`list.insert()`): Inserts an element at a given index.
  - **Remove** (`list.remove()`): Removes the first matching element from the list.
  - **Pop** (`list.pop()`): Removes and returns the element at a given index.
  - **Clear** (`list.clear()`): Removes all elements from the list.
  - **Index** (`list.index()`): Returns the index of the first matching element.
  - **Count** (`list.count()`): Returns the number of times an element appears in the list.
  - **Sort** (`list.sort()`): Sorts the list in place.
  - **Reverse** (`list.reverse()`): Reverses the elements of the list in place.
  - **Copy** (`list.copy()`): Returns a shallow copy of the list.
  - **Membership** (`element in list`): Checks if an element is present in the list.
  - **Concatenation** (`list1 + list2`): Combines two lists.
  - **Length** (`len(list)`): Returns the number of elements in the list.
  - **Iteration** (`for element in list`): Iterates over the elements of the list.
  - **Slicing** (`list[start:end:step]`): Extracts a part of the list.
  - **Sort** (`sorted(list)`): Returns a sorted list from the given iterable.
  - **Max** (`max(list)`): Returns the maximum element of the list.
  - **Min** (`min(list)`): Returns the minimum element of the list.
  - **Sum** (`sum(list)`): Returns the sum of all elements in the list.
  - **Any** (`any(list)`): Checks if any of the elements is True.
  - **All** (`all(list)`): Checks if all elements are True.
  - **Enumerate** (`enumerate(list)`): Returns an iterator of tuples containing indices and values of the list.
  - **Filter** (`filter(function, list)`): Filters elements from the list using a function.
    ```python
    # Using filter and lambda function
    positive_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x > 0, numbers))
    ```
  - **Map** (`map(function, list)`): Applies a function to every element of the list.
    ```python
    # Using map and lambda function to square each element
    squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))
    ```
  - **Reduce** (`reduce(function, list)`): Applies a rolling computation to the list.
    ```python
    # Using reduce and lambda function to find the product of all elements
    product = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, numbers)
    ```

### Stack

- **Definition**:
  - A stack is a data structure that stores elements in a `Last In, First Out (LIFO)` manner.

- **Common Operations**:
  - **Push** (`stack.append()`): Adds an element to the top of the stack.
  - **Pop** (`stack.pop()`): Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
  - **Peek** (`stack[-1]`): Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
  - **Size** (`len(stack)`): Returns the number of elements in the stack.
  - **Empty** (`not stack`): Checks if the stack is empty.

  - **Example**:
  ```python
  stack = []
  stack.append(1)  # [1]
  stack.append(2)  # [1, 2]
  stack.append(3)  # [1, 2, 3]
  stack[-1]        # 3
  stack.pop()      # [1, 2]
  stack.pop()      # [1]
  stack.pop()      # []
  ```
- **Use Cases**:
  - Useful for implementing algorithms such as depth-first search and backtracking.

### Queue

- **Definition**:
  - A queue is a data structure that stores elements in a `First In, First Out (FIFO)` manner.

- **Common Operations**:
  - **Enqueue** (`queue.append()`): Adds an element to the end of the queue.
  - **Dequeue** (`queue.pop(0)`): Removes and returns the first element of the queue.
  - **Peek** (`queue[0]`): Returns the first element of the queue without removing it.
  - **Size** (`len(queue)`): Returns the number of elements in the queue.
  - **Empty** (`not queue`): Checks if the queue is empty.
### Arrays

- **Definition**:
  - Arrays are a data structure that stores elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations.
- **Syntax**:
  - In Python, arrays are often implemented using the NumPy library.
  ```python
  import numpy as np
  
  my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
  ```
- **Mutability**:
  - NumPy arrays are mutable like lists but are more efficient for numerical operations.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Useful for mathematical operations and large datasets.

### Dictionaries

- **Definition**:
  - A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.
- **Syntax**:
  ```python
  my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
  ```
- **Mutability**:
  - Dictionaries are mutable, allowing the addition, modification, and removal of key-value pairs.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Ideal for representing real-world entities with attributes, settings, or configurations.

### Tuple 

A tuple is a `data structure in Python that is similar to a list but with one key difference: it is immutable`. This means that once you create a tuple, you cannot modify its elements. Tuples are defined using parentheses `()`.

Here are some key aspects of tuples and where they are commonly used:

1. **Syntax:**
   - Tuples are created using parentheses. For example: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`

2. **Immutability:**
   - Once a tuple is created, you cannot change, add, or remove elements from it. This immutability makes tuples useful in situations where you want to ensure that the data remains constant.

3. **Use as Dictionary Keys:**
   - Tuples are hashable, which means they can be used as keys in dictionaries. Lists, being mutable, cannot be used as dictionary keys. This hashability is useful in situations where you need to create a compound key for a dictionary.

   ```python
   my_dict = {('a', 1): 'value', ('b', 2): 'another value'}
   ```

4. **Multiple Return Values:**
   - Functions in Python can return multiple values as a tuple. When a function returns multiple values, they are packed into a tuple, and you can easily unpack them when calling the function.

   ```python
   def get_coordinates():
       return 3, 4

   x, y = get_coordinates()
   ```

5. **Unpacking:**
   - Tuples can be used for efficient unpacking of values. This is commonly used in multiple assignment statements.

   ```python
   point = (3, 4)
   x, y = point
   ```

6. **Ordered Sequences:**
   - Tuples, like lists, are ordered sequences. This means the order of elements in a tuple is preserved.

   ```python
   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
   ```

7. **Used in `zip` Function:**
   - Tuples are often used in conjunction with the `zip` function to combine multiple iterables.

   ```python
   names = ('Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie')
   ages = (25, 30, 35)

   combined = zip(names, ages)  # Returns an iterable of tuples
   ```

Overall, tuples are a versatile data structure in Python, and their immutability and hashability make them suitable for various use cases, particularly where you need fixed, ordered collections of elements.


### Sets

- **Definition**:
  - A set is an unordered collection of unique elements in Python.
  - Sets are defined using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` constructor.
  ```python
  my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
  ```

- **Unique Elements**:
  - Sets do not allow duplicate elements. If you try to add a duplicate, it won't be included in the set.
  ```python
  my_set = {1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4}  # Results in {1, 2, 3, 4}
  ```

- **Common Set Operations**:
  - - **Union** (`|`): Combines elements from two sets.
  - - **Intersection** (`&`): Retrieves common elements from two sets.
  - - **Difference** (`-`): Retrieves elements present in the first set but not in the second.
  - - **Symmetric Difference** (`^`): Retrieves elements present in either of the sets, but not both.

  ```python
  set1 = {1, 2, 3}
  set2 = {3, 4, 5}

  union_set = set1 | set2  # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
  intersection_set = set1 & set2  # {3}
  difference_set = set1 - set2  # {1, 2}
  symmetric_difference_set = set1 ^ set2  # {1, 2, 4, 5}
  ```

### Hashing

- **Definition**:
  - Hashing is a process of converting input (or 'message') into a fixed-length string of characters, which is typically a hash code.
  - In Python, hash values are used for various purposes, such as indexing elements in dictionaries or sets.

- **Immutable Objects and Hashing**:
  - In Python, only immutable objects (objects that cannot be changed after creation) are hashable.
  - Immutable objects like integers, floats, strings, and tuples have fixed values and can be hashed.

- **Hash Function**:
  - Python uses a built-in hash function (`hash()`) to generate hash values for objects.
  ```python
  hash_value = hash("example")
  ```

- **Use in Sets and Dictionaries**:
  - Sets and dictionaries use hash values to quickly locate elements.
  - For example, when you check membership in a set or dictionary, Python uses the hash value to determine if the element is present.

- **Custom Hashing**:
  - For custom objects or user-defined classes, you can define a `__hash__` method to provide a custom hash function.

```python
class CustomObject:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __hash__(self):
        return hash(self.value)
```


### Operations 

1. **`and` (Logical AND):**
   - It is a logical operator used for combining two or more boolean expressions.
   - It returns `True` if both operands are true, otherwise, it returns `False`.
   - Example:
     ```python
     result = (x > 0) and (y < 10)
     ```

2. **`&` (Bitwise AND):**
   - It is a bitwise operator used for performing bitwise AND operation on integers.
   - It compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If both bits are 1, the result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, it is set to 0.
   - Example:
     ```python
     result = x & y
     ```

`and` is used for logical operations on boolean values, whereas `&` is used for bitwise operations on integers. Using `and` in a bitwise context or `&` in a logical context might lead to unexpected behavior or errors. It's important to use the appropriate operator based on the context in which you are working.

### Item 11: Know How to Slice Sequences

```python
a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h']

# Basic slicing
print('Middle two:', a[3:5])
print('All but ends:', a[1:7])

# Negative indexing
print(a[:5] == a[0:5])
print(a[5:] == a[5:len(a)])

# Various slicing examples
print(a[:])      # Entire list
print(a[:5])     # First five elements
print(a[:-1])    # All but the last element
print(a[4:])     # Elements from index 4 to the end
print(a[-3:])    # Last three elements
print(a[2:5])    # Elements from index 2 to 4
print(a[2:-1])   # Elements from index 2 to the second-to-last
print(a[-3:-1])  # Elements from the third-to-last to the second-to-last
```

### Item 12: Avoid Striding and Slicing in a Single Expression

```python
# Striding examples
x = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'purple']
odds = x[::2]
evens = x[1::2]

# Striding with negative values
x[::-2]  # Reverse every second item
x[2::2]  # Select every second item starting at index 2

# Avoid striding and slicing in a single expression
y = x[::2]  # Good
z = y[1:-1]  # Good
```

### Item 13: Prefer Catch-All Unpacking Over Slicing

```python
# Basic unpacking
car_ages = [0, 9, 4, 8, 7, 20, 19, 1, 6, 15]
oldest, second_oldest = car_ages[:2]

# Catch-all unpacking
oldest, second_oldest, *others = car_ages_descending

# Using catch-all unpacking for slices
oldest, *others, youngest = car_ages_descending
*others, second_youngest, youngest = car_ages_descending
```

### Item 14: Sort by Complex Criteria Using the key Parameter

```python
class Tool:
    def __init__(self, name, weight):
        self.name = name
        self.weight = weight

tools = [
    Tool('level', 3.5),
    Tool('hammer', 1.25),
    Tool('screwdriver', 0.5),
    Tool('chisel', 0.25),
]

# Sorting by name
tools.sort(key=lambda x: x.name)

# Sorting by weight
tools.sort(key=lambda x: x.weight)

# Sorting by weight descending, then by name ascending
tools.sort(key=lambda x: (x.weight, x.name))

# Sorting by weight descending, then by name ascending (alternative)
tools.sort(key=lambda x: -x.weight)
tools.sort(key=lambda x: x.name)

```

### Item 15: Be Cautious When Relying on dict Insertion Ordering

- In Python 3.5 and earlier, iterating over a dict did not guarantee order.
- Starting with Python 3.6, dictionaries preserve insertion order.
- Be cautious when relying on insertion order for dict-related operations.

```python
# Python 3.5
baby_names = {'cat': 'kitten', 'dog': 'puppy'}
print(list(baby_names.keys()))  # May not preserve insertion order

# Python 3.6+
baby_names = {'cat': 'kitten', 'dog': 'puppy'}
print(list(baby_names.keys()))  # Preserves insertion order
```

### Item 16: Prefer `get` Over `in` and `KeyError` to Handle Missing Dictionary Keys

- Use `get` method for cleaner code when handling missing keys.
- It's efficient and readable compared to `in` checks or catching `KeyError`.

```python
votes = {'otter': 1281, 'polar bear': 587, 'fox': 863}
key = 'wombat'

# Using get
count = votes.get(key, 0)
votes[key] = count + 1
```

### Item 17: Prefer `defaultdict` Over `setdefault` to Handle Missing Items in Internal State

- `defaultdict` from `collections` module simplifies handling missing keys.
- It's more efficient and avoids unnecessary object creation compared to `setdefault`.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Visits:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = defaultdict(set)

    def add(self, country, city):
        self.data[country].add(city)

# Usage
visits = Visits()
visits.add('France', 'Paris')
print(visits.data)
```

### Item 18: Know How to Construct Key-Dependent Default Values with `__missing__`

- Subclass `dict` and implement `__missing__` method to customize default value creation based on keys.

```python
def open_picture(profile_path):
    try:
        return open(profile_path, 'a+b')
    except OSError:
        print(f'Failed to open path {profile_path}')
        raise

class Pictures(dict):
    def __missing__(self, key):
        value = open_picture(key)
        self[key] = value
        return value

# Usage
pictures = Pictures()
handle = pictures['profile_1234.png']
handle.seek(0)
image_data = handle.read()
```


## Item 22: Reduce Visual Noise with Variable Positional Arguments

Accepting a variable number of positional arguments can make a function call clearer and reduce visual noise. These positional arguments are often called varargs or star args.

### Example 1: Basic Usage of *args

```python
def log(message, *values):
    if not values:
        print(message)
    else:
        values_str = ', '.join(str(x) for x in values)
        print(f'{message}: {values_str}')

# Call the function with multiple values
log('My numbers are', 1, 2)
log('Hi there')  # No values passed
```

In this example, the `*values` syntax allows the function to accept a variable number of positional arguments. The function prints the message and, if values are provided, it prints them as well.

### Example 2: Using *args with a Sequence

```python
favorites = [7, 33, 99]
log('Favorite colors', *favorites)
```

The `*` operator can be used to pass items from a sequence as positional arguments to a function. This is useful when you have a list of values to pass.

### Pitfalls:

1. **Generator Exhaustion:**
   ```python
   def my_generator():
       for i in range(10):
           yield i

   def my_func(*args):
       print(args)

   it = my_generator()
   my_func(*it)  # This may consume a lot of memory
   ```

   Be cautious when using *args with generators, as it can lead to generator exhaustion.

2. **Adding New Positional Arguments:**
   ```python
   def log(sequence, message, *values):
       if not values:
           print(f'{sequence} - {message}')
       else:
           values_str = ', '.join(str(x) for x in values)
           print(f'{sequence} - {message}: {values_str}')

   log(1, 'Favorites', 7, 33)        # New with *args OK
   log(1, 'Hi there')                 # New message only OK
   log('Favorite numbers', 7, 33)    # Old usage breaks
   ```

   Adding new positional parameters to functions that accept *args can introduce hard-to-detect bugs. Consider using keyword-only arguments for extension.

**Things to Remember:**
- Functions can accept a variable number of positional arguments by using *args in the def statement.
- The * operator can be used to pass items from a sequence as positional arguments.
- Be cautious with generators, as using *args with them may cause memory issues.
- Adding new positional parameters to functions accepting *args can introduce bugs; consider using keyword-only arguments.


## Item 23: Provide Optional Behavior with Keyword Arguments

Keyword arguments allow you to provide optional parameters to a function, making it more flexible and self-documenting. This can improve the clarity of function calls and make your code more maintainable.

### Example:

```python
def create_person(name, age, job=None, city=None):
    person_info = f"{name}, {age} years old"
    if job:
        person_info += f", works as a {job}"
    if city:
        person_info += f", lives in {city}"
    return person_info

# Call the function with different sets of arguments
person1 = create_person("Alice", 30, job="Engineer", city="New York")
person2 = create_person("Bob", 25, city="San Francisco")

print(person1)
print(person2)
```

In this example, the `create_person` function takes mandatory parameters (`name` and `age`) and two optional parameters (`job` and `city`). By using keyword arguments, you can choose which optional parameters to include when calling the function.

### Benefits of Keyword Arguments:

1. **Clarity and Readability:**
   Keyword arguments make it clear which values correspond to which parameters, improving code readability.

2. **Default Values:**
   Setting default values for keyword arguments allows you to define optional parameters without requiring them in every function call.

3. **Flexibility:**
   Users can choose to provide only the necessary information, ignoring the optional parameters they don't need.

### Pitfall:

- **Mutable Default Values:**
  ```python
  def add_item(item, items=[]):
      items.append(item)
      return items

  result1 = add_item("apple")
  result2 = add_item("banana")

  print(result1)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana']
  ```

  Be cautious when using mutable objects (like lists) as default values for keyword arguments, as they are shared among all calls to the function.

**Things to Remember:**
- Use keyword arguments to provide optional parameters and improve the clarity of function calls.
- Default values for keyword arguments make parameters optional, and users can choose to override them.
- Be cautious with mutable default values to avoid unexpected behavior.

## Item 24: Use `None` and Docstrings to Specify Dynamic Default Arguments

When defining a function with default argument values, using mutable objects (like lists or dictionaries) can lead to unexpected behavior due to shared state between calls. Instead, use `None` as the default and document the behavior clearly using docstrings.

### Example:

```python
def add_item(item, items=None):
    """
    Add an item to the list.

    Parameters:
    - item: The item to add.
    - items: The list to which the item will be added. If None, a new list will be created.

    Returns:
    The updated list.
    """
    if items is None:
        items = []
    items.append(item)
    return items

# Test the function
result1 = add_item("apple")
result2 = add_item("banana")

print(result1)  # Output: ['apple']
print(result2)  # Output: ['banana']
```

In this example, the `add_item` function uses `None` as the default value for the `items` parameter and explicitly checks if it's `None` before creating a new list. This avoids the issue of shared state caused by mutable default values.

### Benefits:

1. **Predictable Behavior:**
   Using `None` as the default value ensures that each call to the function starts with a new, independent object.

2. **Clear Documentation:**
   Including a docstring helps users understand the expected behavior of the function, especially regarding default arguments.

### Pitfall:

- **Mutable Default Values:**
  ```python
  def add_item(item, items=[]):
      """
      Add an item to the list.

      Parameters:
      - item: The item to add.
      - items: The list to which the item will be added. If None, a new list will be created.

      Returns:
      The updated list.
      """
      items.append(item)
      return items

  result1 = add_item("apple")
  result2 = add_item("banana")

  print(result1)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana']
  ```

  If you use a mutable object as a default value without handling it properly, you might encounter unexpected behavior due to shared state.

**Things to Remember:**
- Use `None` as the default value for mutable arguments to avoid shared state.
- Explicitly check for `None` and create a new instance within the function.
- Document the function's behavior, especially regarding default arguments, using docstrings.
