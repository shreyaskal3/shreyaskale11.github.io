# SQL Server Notes

## Introduction to SQL Server

Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft.

## Basic SQL Queries

### SELECT Statement

The `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table
WHERE condition;
```

### INSERT Statement

The `INSERT` statement is used to insert data into a table.

```sql
INSERT INTO table (column1, column2)
VALUES (value1, value2);
```

### UPDATE Statement

The `UPDATE` statement is used to modify existing records in a table.

```sql
UPDATE table
SET column1 = value1
WHERE condition;
```

### DELETE Statement

The `DELETE` statement is used to delete records from a table.

```sql
DELETE FROM table
WHERE condition;
```

## Joins

### INNER JOIN

The `INNER JOIN` keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

### LEFT OUTER JOIN

The `LEFT OUTER JOIN` keyword returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table1
LEFT OUTER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

### RIGHT OUTER JOIN

The `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` keyword returns all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table1
RIGHT OUTER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

## Aggregate Functions

### COUNT

The `COUNT` function is used to count the number of rows in a result set.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(column)
FROM table;
```

### AVG

The `AVG` function calculates the average value of a numeric column.

```sql
SELECT AVG(column)
FROM table;
```
