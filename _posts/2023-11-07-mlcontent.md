## K-Means Clustering

### Basics of Clustering

Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning that involves grouping similar data points into clusters. The objective is to maximize the intra-cluster similarity and minimize the inter-cluster similarity. Clustering is widely used in various domains, such as customer segmentation, image segmentation, and anomaly detection.

### K-Means Algorithm

K-Means is a popular clustering algorithm that partitions data into K clusters based on similarity. The algorithm works iteratively:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Randomly select K data points as initial centroids.
  
2. **Assignment:**
   - Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, forming K clusters.
  
3. **Update Centroids:**
   - Recalculate the centroids as the mean of data points in each cluster.
  
4. **Iteration:**
   - Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence (when centroids no longer change significantly).

K-Means converges to a local minimum, and the choice of K is crucial. Common methods for selecting K include the elbow method and silhouette analysis.

### Evaluation Metrics for Clustering

Evaluation metrics help assess the quality of clustering results. Common metrics include:

- **Silhouette Score:**
  - Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). Ranges from -1 to 1, where a higher score indicates better-defined clusters.

- **Davies-Bouldin Index:**
  - Measures the compactness and separation of clusters. Lower values indicate better clustering.

## Hierarchical Clustering

### Agglomerative and Divisive Clustering

Hierarchical clustering builds a tree of clusters. There are two main approaches:

1. **Agglomerative (Bottom-Up):**
   - Start with individual data points as clusters.
   - Merge the closest clusters iteratively until all points belong to a single cluster.

2. **Divisive (Top-Down):**
   - Start with all data points in one cluster.
   - Split the cluster recursively until each point is in its cluster.

Agglomerative clustering is more common. The choice of linkage criteria (single, complete, average, etc.) determines how the distance between clusters is calculated.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### Dimensionality Reduction

PCA is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of data while preserving its variability. It transforms the data into a new coordinate system (principal components) where the variance is maximized along the axes.

### Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues

In PCA, eigenvectors and eigenvalues are crucial. The eigenvectors represent the directions of maximum variance, and the corresponding eigenvalues indicate the magnitude of variance along those directions. The higher the eigenvalue, the more important the corresponding eigenvector in describing the data.

## Association Rule Mining

### Apriori Algorithm

The Apriori algorithm is used for discovering interesting relationships (associations) among variables in large datasets. It works by iteratively finding frequent itemsets and generating association rules. Key steps include:

1. **Support Calculation:**
   - Identify itemsets that meet a minimum support threshold.

2. **Rule Generation:**
   - Create rules from the frequent itemsets.

3. **Confidence and Lift:**
   - Assess the quality of rules using confidence (conditional probability) and lift (how much more likely the consequent is, given the antecedent).
