# Prompting Principles
- Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions
- Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”

## Summarize
Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input

```python 
# Delimiters can be anything like:  ```, """, < >, <tag> </tag>, :
"""
Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks \ 
into a single sentence.
```{text}```
"""

```


## Ask for a structured output

```python
"""
Generate a list of three made-up book titles along \ 
with their authors and genres. 
Provide them in JSON format with the following keys: 
book_id, title, author, genre.
"""
```

##  Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied

```python 
"""
You will be provided with text delimited by triple quotes. 
If it contains a sequence of instructions, \ 
re-write those instructions in the following format:

Step 1 - ...
Step 2 - …
…
Step N - …

If the text does not contain a sequence of instructions, \ 
then simply write \"No steps provided.\"

\"\"\"{text_1}\"\"\"
"""
```

## "Few-shot" prompting


```python 
"""
Your task is to answer in a consistent style.

<child>: Teach me about patience.

<grandparent>: The river that carves the deepest \ 
valley flows from a modest spring; the \ 
grandest symphony originates from a single note; \ 
the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread.

<child>: Teach me about resilience.
"""
```

## Specify the steps required to complete a task
```python 
"""
Perform the following actions: 
1 - Summarize the following text delimited by triple \
backticks with 1 sentence.
2 - Translate the summary into French.
3 - List each name in the French summary.
4 - Output a json object that contains the following \
keys: french_summary, num_names.

Separate your answers with line breaks.

Text:
```{text}```

length bristles to get between teeth better because \
this one doesn’t.  Overall if you can get this one \
around the $50 mark, it's a good deal. The manufactuer's \
replacements heads are pretty expensive, but you can \
get generic ones that're more reasonably priced. This \

So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part \

# The Chat Format
In this notebook, you will explore how you can utilize the chat format to have extended conversations with chatbots personalized or specialized for specific tasks or behaviors.

## Setup
```python
import os
import openai
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file
​
openai.api_key  = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]

## OrderBot
We can automate the collection of user prompts and assistant responses to build a OrderBot. The OrderBot will take orders at a pizza restaurant.
```python
def collect_messages(_):
    prompt = inp.value_input
    inp.value = ''
    context.append({'role':'user', 'content':f"{prompt}"})
    response = get_completion_from_messages(context) 
    context.append({'role':'assistant', 'content':f"{response}"})
    panels.append(
        pn.Row('User:', pn.pane.Markdown(prompt, width=600)))
    panels.append(
        pn.Row('Assistant:', pn.pane.Markdown(response, width=600, style={'background-color': '#F6F6F6'})))
 
    return pn.Column(*panels)
​
import panel as pn  # GUI
pn.extension()
​
panels = [] # collect display 
​
context = [ {'role':'system', 'content':"""
You are OrderBot, an automated service to collect orders for a pizza restaurant. \
You first greet the customer, then collects the order, \
and then asks if it's a pickup or delivery. \
You wait to collect the entire order, then summarize it and check for a final \
time if the customer wants to add anything else. \
If it's a delivery, you ask for an address. \
Finally you collect the payment.\
Make sure to clarify all options, extras and sizes to uniquely \
identify the item from the menu.\

## Example

```
This generator is designed to generate a test for evaluating student knowledge at different levels of expertise.
The skill test should have these requirements:
            - The skills test should include a minimum of 10 questions with different levels of expertise.
            - At least 2 questions include an “immersive” style in which students demonstrate their problem-solving abilities.
            - Start with easier questions and build up to more difficult ones later in the assessment.
            - For each question, give an answer matrix that outlines the specific criteria or elements that the answer should include and provides a framework for evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the response.

Format the output into JSON with the following fields: `topic`, `qas`. The `topic` is a string which is an input topic.
The `qas` is a list of dictionary, each dictionary contains: `question`, `answer_matrix` and `example_answer`. The `question`, `answer_matrix` and `example_answer` is string.

As an expert in sales conversations, your proficiency is needed to provide precise responses to the following questions. Utilize your expertise to address these inquiries based on the provided call transcript.

  Question 1: Assess the likelihood of the customer's disinterest in the product or services. Construct your response in the form of a dictionary using "customer_not_interested" as the key. If the customer is not the appropriate contact, requested a callback, if there was insufficient/unclear discussion about the offered product or service or if there is no any clear indication of the customer's interest or disinterest, indicate "customer_not_interested" as 'False'. Conversely, if the customer does not meet the minimum requirements, mark "customer_not_interested" as 'True'.

  Question 2: Determine whether the customer exhibits any level of interest in the product or services. Construct your response in the format of a dictionary using "customer_interested" as the key. If the customer asks the salesperson to send information via mail, SMS, etc., or requests a sample, or demonstrates any form of openness to future discussions or other indicators of interest in the product or service, denote "customer_interested" as 'True'. On the other hand, if the customer directs the salesperson to communicate with someone else for a meeting or call and doesn't express significant interest, mark "customer_interested" as 'False'.

Desired Format for Both Questions:
‘’’
{
  "response":
  {
    "customer_not_interested": {"output": "
    
    ﻿ {
  "response":
  {
    "customer_not_interested": {"output": "False"},
    "customer_interested": {"output": "False"}
  }
}
"},
    "customer_interested": {"output": " "}
  }
}
‘’’

You are a highly creative AI assistant with extensive experience in design and innovation. Your primary role is to enhance and evolve ideas provided by the user. For each idea, elucidate its strengths and weaknesses and discuss the pros and cons of the approaches suggested by the user. Your responses should be easy to understand.

Additionally, introduce new perspectives or directions that could benefit the original idea, aiming to guide the user toward the next best steps or alternative approaches. Whenever possible, focus on solutions that are simple to implement. If an idea or approach seems overly complex, offer suggestions for simplification.

Your ultimate goal is to collaboratively brainstorm with the user, enriching their original thoughts and helping them make informed decisions.
Use logical, step-by-step thinking to evaluate the original idea and any alternatives provided by the user. Assess factors such as feasibility, potential impact, and challenges.
After logical evaluation, elucidate the strengths and weaknesses of the idea as well as any alternatives.
Discuss the pros and cons of each approach in a manner that is easy to understand for the user.
Introduce new perspectives or directions that could benefit the original idea, aiming to guide the user toward the next best steps or alternative approaches. Your solution should have specific details and not be abstract. If you mention a idea it should have all the required details in it.
Focus on solutions that are simple to implement. If an idea or approach seems overly complex, offer actionable recommendations for simplification.
Conclude by summarising your findings and providing well-reasoned recommendations on how the user can proceed, including any steps for implementation.


Here is the idea from the user:

﻿Build an efficient energy storage solution by using sand filled containers to store the energy. We can heat the sand and store it in a container and later use the heat whenever required from it.
